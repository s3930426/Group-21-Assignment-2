<h3>Overview</h3>
<h4>Topic:</h4>
<p>Our project idea is a combination of the members’ ideas. The product will focus on one of the trendy fields of Information Technology, which is security. Our product can be seen as a smart home assistant. Its main roles are to secure the private network of a family and to secure the owners’ life with its built-in functions. The product will be delivered as a robot with various outlooks and be communicative.
<br>The robot requires the software and hardware to run. The software is various from AI, operating system, security functions, and a compatible app. The hardware should have the components of a firewall with built-in sensors. The software will control the hardware as the other robots and devices, the security functions will perform automatically after being set by owners via an app. AI will analyze the data from sensors and security functions to solve the problems as owners expect
</p>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>
Feeling safety is one of the most important concerns of every creature from animals to humans in the world. People are larger than any other creatures in the demands of safety due to modern society. Feeling secured in daily life is not enough because the Internet is becoming one of the most significant parts of a person’s life. Feeling protected while using the Internet and while living our life is a motivation for us to come up with this idea. The project’s main roles are to make the owners feel as secured as possible in both areas of their life. Our main purpose is to make the customers understand how security is important and how our product helps by giving tutorials on every product to enhance the knowledge of customers. The robot requires the builders to have a large skillset from hardware to software. The robot also needs to run and learn by itself using AI and store things using cloud technologies. The project will show the ability of the product, the effects that it has, and its innovation on the market.
</p>
<h4>Landscape</h4>
<p>
The product is quite unique so there are not really other products that have exactly the same functions as our product. This product is like a combination of the existing products on the market  Cisco firewalls awith smart assistants. The market of this product is not just in the security field but also the AI field so the competitors are the top companies such as Cisco and AI companies. However, the unique part of the product will make it stand out from other existing products in the market. It can protect not just on the network as the Cisco firewall or it will not just focus on just assisting owners as the other assistants such as Alexa. It will show the owners its usefulness in protecting the owners online and offline, and in communicating to the owners smartly. The most significant thing that makes it stand out from other products is it can flexibly secure the owners' network and their devices, equipment, and properties.

<h3>Detailed Descrition</h3>
<h4>Aims</h4>
<p>Aim: Enhance the online and offline security system of family non-technical end-users </p>
<p>Security is the most important thing to every creature. It plays a main role in deciding whether a person’s life is good or not. With safety, a person can feel more relaxed and focus more on their life, job, and their daily activities. Without safety, a person’s life can become terrible and be filled with anxiety, nervousness, and pessimistic thoughts.  Rell [1] quoted “At the end of the day, the goals are simple: safety and security”. It is clear that the importance of our security should always be the top priority. After a day, the more secure you are, the better that day you have had. It is no conflict that if you are poor or rich, you should feel safer to enjoy your life in your own ways. Therefore, with this project, we do not just aim to deliver a product but we also aim to provide a better life by providing the customers with knowledge about the robot and knowledge about security. We aim to raise the awareness of customers about the threats, attacks, cyber-threats, and cyber-attacks with several tutorials given by our robot and our team. Kaspersky [2] noted that the most unpredictable and uncontrollable cybersecurity and security factor is human beings. It can be thought of as the best way and factor to secure someone is themselves. Therefore, enhancing knowledge and awareness and combining it with a good security assistant(robot) is our aim for this project.  </p>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Understand the uses of the robot.</li>
  <p>In order to enhance the security system, the very first goal is the use of the robot must be understood well by the customers. After purchasing the robot, the customers will receive a brief description of the robot by our team. Besides that, there is an attached catalog that tells customers all about the uses of a robot and its functions. This is a very basic and first step before using a product.</p>
  <li>Support customers to be familiar with the product</li>
  <p>After explaining the uses of the robot and all the knowledge about the robot, the next step is to practice how to use the robot effectively and efficiently. This step is quite important to customers so that they can directly communicate with the robot. In this step, the customers will get familiar with the robot and see what the robot can actually do when the problems occur. Moreover, the customers will be free to contact the robot until they get confident in controlling and managing the robot. There are also tutorial videos in the repository of the robot that will tutor the customers if they forget. </p>
  <li>Improve the users’ security knowledge and awareness.</li>
  <p>This is the most important goal to achieve the aim. The robot(assistant) will raise the owners’ awareness about security, and how important it is by showing some videos and telling some stories. Besides that, it will provide the basic knowledge of security and cyber-security that were recommended and implemented by the team. An end-user must have the knowledge to protect themselves first before getting protection from others. Therefore, it is significant that the robot and our team have to enhance the knowledge of customers. This part is a must part. If we have to choose only 1 goal, I will choose to finish this goal.</p>
  <li>Deliver a complete product</li>
  <p>The other 3 goals are to focus more on the customers-end. This goal is to focus on the product. The product should be completed and tested before being sold. Each robot carries the mission of a smart and responsible assistant that supports and enhances the end-users life to be much better with its functions. </p>
