        <h3>Team Profile</h3>
          <p>My name is Nguyen Hieu Duc Duy, I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I will turn 23 in 2022. My student number is s3930426. I am fluently using Vietnamese and English. I am attracted to computers and games which are the reason for me to take the Bachelor of Information Technology. Besides that, I have a few hobbies to enjoy while I have free time and to reduce stress such as playing cardistry and working out at the gym. I have a special interest in cybersecurity, which was fired up by a hacker who hacked my email years ago. Because I am just a second-year student, I have not had been able to arrange my time to work while studying. However, I am planning to work while studying soon.  </p>
          <p>My name is Vuong Quang Duy, and I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City for most of my life, therefore I have grown to have a deep bond with the Vietnam urban cityscape and culture. However, it is important to note that my English skills are developed via exposure to western or foreign culture and media primarily came from television and Internet, and it has been further enriched during my high school years at the Canadian International School. Thus, now I can speak semi-fluent Vietnamese and English. Throughout the years, my family and peers would often refer to me as an imaginative and adaptable person. And while those two aspects are mostly what I see in myself, I personally think the latter has not been very consistent and hope to improve it at RMIT. My hobbies are primarily creative based activities such as character drawing, story writing, and building virtual Lego models. I have also been looking into designing games and proper 3D modelling, which is why I have spent time watching tutorials on these hobbies prior to RMIT. While my hobbies and interests do not necessarily have a strict relation to IT, I still hope this course can provide me valuable information which can aid me in my future pursuits and/or help me make a sustainable living out of my interests. </p>
