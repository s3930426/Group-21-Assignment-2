        <h3>Personal Information</h3>

          <p>My name is Nguyen Hieu Duc Duy, I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I will turn 23 in 2022. My student number is s3930426. I am fluently using Vietnamese and English. I am attracted to computers and games which are the reason for me to take the Bachelor of Information Technology. Besides that, I have a few hobbies to enjoy while I have free time and to reduce stress such as playing cardistry and working out at the gym. I have a special interest in cybersecurity ,which was fired up by a hacker who hacked my email years ago. Because I am just a second-year student, I have not had been able to arrange my time to work while studying. However, I am planning to work while studying soon.  </p>

          <p>My name is Vuong Quang Duy, and I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City for most of my life, therefore I have grown to have a deep bond with the Vietnam urban cityscape and culture. However, it is important to note that my English skills are developed via exposure to western or foreign culture and media primarily came from television and Internet, and it has been further enriched during my high school years at the Canadian International School. Thus, now I can speak semi-fluent Vietnamese and English. Throughout the years, my family and peers would often refer to me as an imaginative and adaptable person. And while those two aspects are mostly what I see in myself, I personally think the latter has not been very consistent and hope to improve it at RMIT. My hobbies are primarily creative based activities such as character drawing, story writing, and building virtual Lego models. I have also been looking into designing games and proper 3D modelling, which is why I have spent time watching tutorials on these hobbies prior to RMIT. While my hobbies and interests do not necessarily have a strict relation to IT, I still hope this course can provide me valuable information which can aid me in my future pursuits and/or help me make a sustainable living out of my interests. </p>

          <p> My name is Dang Trung Hieu, and I am from Ho Chi Minh city, I was raised in a family with a deep passion for music and instruments. I had always been busy with various musical instruments because my dad wanted me to play each of his favorite instruments. Through time, I had developed a passion for guitar, my all-time favorite. Next, just a few days to my 13th birthday, a friend of mine introduce me to hip-hop, a music genre originally created by the African-American, which shape my vision and thoughts about life until now. After a period of time, hip-hop is really all I think about, so I start writing music and making music beats on my laptop. After 2 years of making music via my laptop, I start to grow interested in computer science and programming. With the words of encouragement from my grade 12 IT teacher, I decided to make IT become my main major, and put my rap dream back to the storage where I will open after I succeed as an IT technician. </p>

          <p>My name is Bui Quang Khai from Binh Phuoc province. My student number is s3752113. I started studying in Ho Chi Minh city when I was 12 years old. English is my second language, but I still have to practice becoming better at it. I choose the Bachelor of Information Technology because of the interest in computer and game development. My first hobbies are playing board games. Not many people enjoy board games these days but collecting them is still one hobby of mine. The second is playing games. I’m not always sitting on a chair and playing games all day but joining the game community is like social networking, you can share the highlight or party with other members is one of the most things I enjoy it. About the future job, I’m not actually thinking about it. My ability to handle work is quite cumbersome so I will choose a freelance job rather than a permanent job. Of course, until I have enough knowledge, I can switch to a permanent job. </p>

          <p>How these tests help us to manage the team: At first glance, our team’s members all have the unique traits that form our personalities, we all have our distinguish role with both advantages and disadvantages. With the result from the 3 tests, they help us to distribute the jobs and requirements for each member, allowing us to have the job that is also our advantage. Duc Duy’s role is the defender, a role that is known for the sturdiness and the power to lead everyone, so we decided to let him be the leader. Quang Duy’s role is the explorer, a role that is known for bravery and curiosity, a perfect role for the interview job. For myself, Trung Hieu, my role is the humanist, a role that is known for the empathy and understanding of human’s relationships, my role is fit perfectly for the jobs of connecting everyone and helping the members to overcome their issues. Quang Khai’s role is logistician, a role that is known for carefulness and logical thinking, a perfect role to do jobs like revision and arranging information. Our group decided to let Khai be the reviser and let him take care of the arrangement.  </p>

        <h3>Ideal Jobs</h3>
          <p>Our team members have all four different ideal jobs, for Duc Duy, his ideal jobs are a cyber security specialist which is a perfect ideal job for his personality, a job that requires reliability and leading skills, and a large amount of system protecting experiences. For Quang Duy, his ideal job is a Unity developer, which is a 2D-3D game developer using an online engine call Unity 3D. Quang Duy’s role is the explorer, not like Duc Duy, a defender that is reliable and sturdy, Quang Duy’s ideal job requires a high amount of creativity that can help the company to have more new and exciting games, luckily, Quang Duy’s role is the explorer, who has a creative and open-mind that like to try new things. I, Trung Hieu, my perfect ideal job is a DevOps, a job that requires both development and operation skills, this job not only requires a person with deep experience with computers and platforms but also a person that knows how to connect people and understand the employee’s feeling. My role is the humanist, which is perfect for the operation part, but I still need to study more to have more experience with computer platforms. Quang Khai’s ideal job is a game developer like Quang Duy, however, Quang Duy’s ideal job requires a person with high experience in the Unity engine, in the other hand, Quang Khai’s ideal job requires a person with creative ideas that can manage and set up the plan for the company. It is quite similar for Duy and Khai, but when looking into the details, the job that they choose is exactly for them, Quang Duy with more experience in computer platforms can fit his job’s requirements, and Quang Khai with the great ability with arrangement can fit with the role of a visioner for his ideal job as a game developer.  </p>
