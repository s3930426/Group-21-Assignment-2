      <h2>1.Team Profile</h2>
        <h3>Team Name:</h3><span> Team 21</span>
          <p></p>
        <h3>Personal Information</h3>

          <p>My name is Nguyen Hieu Duc Duy, I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I will turn 23 in 2022. My student number is s3930426. I am fluently using Vietnamese and English. I am attracted to computers and games which are the reason for me to take the Bachelor of Information Technology. Besides that, I have a few hobbies to enjoy while I have free time and to reduce stress such as playing cardistry and working out at the gym. I have a special interest in cybersecurity ,which was fired up by a hacker who hacked my email years ago. Because I am just a second-year student, I have not had been able to arrange my time to work while studying. However, I am planning to work while studying soon.  </p>

          <p>My name is Vuong Quang Duy, and I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City for most of my life, therefore I have grown to have a deep bond with the Vietnam urban cityscape and culture. However, it is important to note that my English skills are developed via exposure to western or foreign culture and media primarily came from television and Internet, and it has been further enriched during my high school years at the Canadian International School. Thus, now I can speak semi-fluent Vietnamese and English. Throughout the years, my family and peers would often refer to me as an imaginative and adaptable person. And while those two aspects are mostly what I see in myself, I personally think the latter has not been very consistent and hope to improve it at RMIT. My hobbies are primarily creative based activities such as character drawing, story writing, and building virtual Lego models. I have also been looking into designing games and proper 3D modelling, which is why I have spent time watching tutorials on these hobbies prior to RMIT. While my hobbies and interests do not necessarily have a strict relation to IT, I still hope this course can provide me valuable information which can aid me in my future pursuits and/or help me make a sustainable living out of my interests. </p>

          <p> My name is Dang Trung Hieu, and I am from Ho Chi Minh city, I was raised in a family with a deep passion for music and instruments. I had always been busy with various musical instruments because my dad wanted me to play each of his favorite instruments. Through time, I had developed a passion for guitar, my all-time favorite. Next, just a few days to my 13th birthday, a friend of mine introduce me to hip-hop, a music genre originally created by the African-American, which shape my vision and thoughts about life until now. After a period of time, hip-hop is really all I think about, so I start writing music and making music beats on my laptop. After 2 years of making music via my laptop, I start to grow interested in computer science and programming. With the words of encouragement from my grade 12 IT teacher, I decided to make IT become my main major, and put my rap dream back to the storage where I will open after I succeed as an IT technician. </p>

          <p>My name is Bui Quang Khai from Binh Phuoc province. My student number is s3752113. I started studying in Ho Chi Minh city when I was 12 years old. English is my second language, but I still have to practice becoming better at it. I choose the Bachelor of Information Technology because of the interest in computer and game development. My first hobbies are playing board games. Not many people enjoy board games these days but collecting them is still one hobby of mine. The second is playing games. I’m not always sitting on a chair and playing games all day but joining the game community is like social networking, you can share the highlight or party with other members is one of the most things I enjoy it. About the future job, I’m not actually thinking about it. My ability to handle work is quite cumbersome so I will choose a freelance job rather than a permanent job. Of course, until I have enough knowledge, I can switch to a permanent job. </p>

          <p>How these tests help us to manage the team: At first glance, our team’s members all have the unique traits that form our personalities, we all have our distinguish role with both advantages and disadvantages. With the result from the 3 tests, they help us to distribute the jobs and requirements for each member, allowing us to have the job that is also our advantage. Duc Duy’s role is the defender, a role that is known for the sturdiness and the power to lead everyone, so we decided to let him be the leader. Quang Duy’s role is the explorer, a role that is known for bravery and curiosity, a perfect role for the interview job. For myself, Trung Hieu, my role is the humanist, a role that is known for the empathy and understanding of human’s relationships, my role is fit perfectly for the jobs of connecting everyone and helping the members to overcome their issues. Quang Khai’s role is logistician, a role that is known for carefulness and logical thinking, a perfect role to do jobs like revision and arranging information. Our group decided to let Khai be the reviser and let him take care of the arrangement.  </p>

        <h3>Ideal Jobs</h3>
          <p>Our team members have all four different ideal jobs, for Duc Duy, his ideal jobs are a cyber security specialist which is a perfect ideal job for his personality, a job that requires reliability and leading skills, and a large amount of system protecting experiences. For Quang Duy, his ideal job is a Unity developer, which is a 2D-3D game developer using an online engine call Unity 3D. Quang Duy’s role is the explorer, not like Duc Duy, a defender that is reliable and sturdy, Quang Duy’s ideal job requires a high amount of creativity that can help the company to have more new and exciting games, luckily, Quang Duy’s role is the explorer, who has a creative and open-mind that like to try new things. I, Trung Hieu, my perfect ideal job is a DevOps, a job that requires both development and operation skills, this job not only requires a person with deep experience with computers and platforms but also a person that knows how to connect people and understand the employee’s feeling. My role is the humanist, which is perfect for the operation part, but I still need to study more to have more experience with computer platforms. Quang Khai’s ideal job is a game developer like Quang Duy, however, Quang Duy’s ideal job requires a person with high experience in the Unity engine, in the other hand, Quang Khai’s ideal job requires a person with creative ideas that can manage and set up the plan for the company. It is quite similar for Duy and Khai, but when looking into the details, the job that they choose is exactly for them, Quang Duy with more experience in computer platforms can fit his job’s requirements, and Quang Khai with the great ability with arrangement can fit with the role of a visioner for his ideal job as a game developer.  </p>

        <p>The commit history clearly announces the steps that have been done by an editor. Besides that, it is very convenient for people to control what has been done after pausing time. If a group of people is working together on the same project, it will be easier for other people to follow the process. Moreover, it can show who did what at what time. Everything will be recorded. </p>

        <h3>Cybersecurity and privacy </h3>
          <p>The Internet has been growing speedy since the 2000s. Some several technological developments and changes change the whole world such as social media, smartphones, cryptocurrencies, cloud services, AR/VR, artificial intelligence, etc. The whole world is being computerized. Using the Internet helps people to catch up with the world and get easier to contact others. However, the rapid development causes unbalance between how to use and how to secure the Internet. The lack of cyber security knowledge can lead to loss, being attacked, and not having privacy, which indirectly helps the cybersecurity major to be developed. Therefore, what is cybersecurity? What does exactly cybersecurity do? Security is a term of protecting against criminal activities, danger, damage, and loss. The term cybersecurity is hard to clearly define because it is broadly used, highly variable, and uninformative, which is stated by Craigen et al. [1]. However, it can be understood as the processes and policies to protect the information, privacy, and data on private and public networks, systems, local servers, databases, and many other aspects of the Internet. Moreover, Kaspersky [2] reported that people are the most unpredictable cybersecurity factor. It is clear that not just the protection of hardware, software, and electrical devices are covered in the term cybersecurity but also the people need to be enhanced their knowledge of protecting themselves. As the threats and cyber-attacks have been growing since the 2000s, the demands of being secured while using the Internet has been also growing. Cybersecurity has been invested, studied, and developed for decades. Everything which is connected to the Internet nowadays is mostly secured by one of the most recent and basic processes with three factors authentication, authorization, and encryption. Authentication is to clarify that person is the exact one. Authorization goes after authentication; it clarifies the rights of that authenticated person. Encryption is to enhance the security of information such as passwords and secret information in the database. With the current technology, there are various types of authentications. Instead of entering passwords to authenticate, Fingerprint, Face ID, and Eyes scanning are being applied to authenticate. Besides that, there is not just one algorithm or way to encrypt data, there are many types of algorithms being developed such as Triple DES, SHA 256, RSA, MD5, etc. With the rapid development of cybersecurity, security hardware and third-party applications have been also developed. The firewall is one of the security hardware mentioned above, it is at the third layer of the TCP/IP model. Its main functions are to control and secure the inbounds and outbounds of a private network. Nowadays, operating systems such as Windows, IOS, macOS, etc. provide their security functions but there are also several security applications such as McAfee, BKAV, Kaspersky, etc. to enhance the protection of devices. All the technologies listed above are the current technologies, which help users to reduce times of cyber-attacks locally and globally and be able to solve the issues remotely. The world is developing AI to enhance cybersecurity but there are several conflicts about its advantages and disadvantages. Vyas [3] reported that AI in cybersecurity can process large volumes of data, have greater adaptability, early detection of cybersecurity risks, etc. Vyas [3] also reported that the advantages of AI can also benefit hackers, breach of privacy, higher cost, uncontrollable, etc. It is clear that AI in cybersecurity can bring benefits and have several downsides. Goud [4] reported that if the AI in cybersecurity had not been controlled, it could have been spelled doom in 2024. Therefore, AI can be seen as a future cybersecurity technology and predicted to develop in the future.



          In this computerized world, the development in cybersecurity can impact the whole world. Every job, every organization will be affected. From hospitals to businesses and education systems, from IT pros to normal end-users will be directly and indirectly affected. If AI is developed in cybersecurity, it will help cybersecurity specialists to reduce their volumes of work. AI can be seen as a useful assistant to support users. Cybersecurity specialists will be the most affected if AI takes place in cybersecurity areas. There are pros and cons. People who study cybersecurity as a major will have to study knowledge about AI as an assistant. Besides that, the way, method, or process at work will be differentiated, there may be a new model of working which would be AI-human combination Vyas [3] stated.  Moreover, the volumes of work will be reduced much and if the volumes of work are reduced, which will lead to reducing the demands of recruitment in this area. In contrast, the AI developers recruited demands will be increased, which can lead to the rapid growth of the AI area, the change in the way of educating about AI. The development is also a good idea for normal end-users if AI is built-in firewalls or routers, which leads to the home-network security and privacy will be strengthened. Instead of having just operating systems defender applications, third-party applications, and firewalls at home to secure private networks, there is 1 more additional method that is more intelligent, controllable, and useful in managing all the other 3 methods.



          The role of cybersecurity and privacy is getting more significant. The more it is developed, the better life people will have. Imagine that we are surfing the Internet to relax after a tiring day, and then we received a notification that our information gets leaked, scammed, and hacked just because of links we just clicked. That would be a disaster to our mental and physical health. Therefore, we need to secure ourselves to be relaxed while using the Internet. My bank information got leaked once, I lost all of my money, but the bank and the cyber police helped me to get back what I lost. Therefore, I knew that without having cybersecurity, my life would not have been great. The development of cybersecurity will provide me with more attraction as I am interested in a cybersecurity major. Besides that, I will have more knowledge about cybersecurity so that I can protect myself from being cyber-attacks. I may help myself and my family to have good relaxing times on social media or on the Internet with limited concerns about the safety and the danger of the links, emails, or messages in my daily life. Having a really relaxing time after a tiring day by using the Internet can help people to recover their mental health and reduce stress. Moreover, people can be more productive on the next day which will increase the life quality of families and the entire country. </p>
