<h3>Overview</h3>
<h4>Topic:</h4>
<p>Our project idea is a combination of the members’ ideas. The product will focus on one of the trendy fields of Information Technology, which is security. Our product can be seen as a smart home assistant. Its main roles are to secure the private network of a family and to secure the owners’ life with its built-in functions. The product will be delivered as a robot with various outlooks and be communicative.
<br>The robot requires the software and hardware to run. The software is various from AI, operating system, security functions, and a compatible app. The hardware should have the components of a firewall with built-in sensors. The software will control the hardware as the other robots and devices, the security functions will perform automatically after being set by owners via an app. AI will analyze the data from sensors and security functions to solve the problems as owners expect
</p>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>
Feeling safety is one of the most important concerns of every creature from animals to humans in the world. People are larger than any other creatures in the demands of safety due to modern society. Feeling secured in daily life is not enough because the Internet is becoming one of the most significant parts of a person’s life. Feeling protected while using the Internet and while living our life is a motivation for us to come up with this idea. The project’s main roles are to make the owners feel as secured as possible in both areas of their life. Our main purpose is to make the customers understand how security is important and how our product helps by giving tutorials on every product to enhance the knowledge of customers. The robot requires the builders to have a large skillset from hardware to software. The robot also needs to run and learn by itself using AI and store things using cloud technologies. The project will show the ability of the product, the effects that it has, and its innovation on the market.
</p>
<h4>Landscape</h4>
<p>
The product is quite unique so there are not really other products that have exactly the same functions as our product. This product is like a combination of the existing products on the market  Cisco firewalls awith smart assistants. The market of this product is not just in the security field but also the AI field so the competitors are the top companies such as Cisco and AI companies. However, the unique part of the product will make it stand out from other existing products in the market. It can protect not just on the network as the Cisco firewall or it will not just focus on just assisting owners as the other assistants such as Alexa. It will show the owners its usefulness in protecting the owners online and offline, and in communicating to the owners smartly. The most significant thing that makes it stand out from other products is it can flexibly secure the owners' network and their devices, equipment, and properties.
</p>
<h3>Detailed Descrition</h3>
<h4>Aims</h4>
<p>Aim: Enhance the online and offline security system of family non-technical end-users </p>
<p>Security is the most important thing to every creature. It plays a main role in deciding whether a person’s life is good or not. With safety, a person can feel more relaxed and focus more on their life, job, and their daily activities. Without safety, a person’s life can become terrible and be filled with anxiety, nervousness, and pessimistic thoughts.  Rell [1] quoted “At the end of the day, the goals are simple: safety and security”. It is clear that the importance of our security should always be the top priority. After a day, the more secure you are, the better that day you have had. It is no conflict that if you are poor or rich, you should feel safer to enjoy your life in your own ways. Therefore, with this project, we do not just aim to deliver a product but we also aim to provide a better life by providing the customers with knowledge about the robot and knowledge about security. We aim to raise the awareness of customers about the threats, attacks, cyber-threats, and cyber-attacks with several tutorials given by our robot and our team. Kaspersky [2] noted that the most unpredictable and uncontrollable cybersecurity and security factor is human beings. It can be thought of as the best way and factor to secure someone is themselves. Therefore, enhancing knowledge and awareness and combining it with a good security assistant(robot) is our aim for this project.  </p>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Understand the uses of the robot.</li>
  <p>In order to enhance the security system, the very first goal is the use of the robot must be understood well by the customers. After purchasing the robot, the customers will receive a brief description of the robot by our team. Besides that, there is an attached catalog that tells customers all about the uses of a robot and its functions. This is a very basic and first step before using a product.</p>
  <li>Support customers to be familiar with the product</li>
  <p>After explaining the uses of the robot and all the knowledge about the robot, the next step is to practice how to use the robot effectively and efficiently. This step is quite important to customers so that they can directly communicate with the robot. In this step, the customers will get familiar with the robot and see what the robot can actually do when the problems occur. Moreover, the customers will be free to contact the robot until they get confident in controlling and managing the robot. There are also tutorial videos in the repository of the robot that will tutor the customers if they forget. </p>
  <li>Improve the users’ security knowledge and awareness.</li>
  <p>This is the most important goal to achieve the aim. The robot(assistant) will raise the owners’ awareness about security, and how important it is by showing some videos and telling some stories. Besides that, it will provide the basic knowledge of security and cyber-security that were recommended and implemented by the team. An end-user must have the knowledge to protect themselves first before getting protection from others. Therefore, it is significant that the robot and our team have to enhance the knowledge of customers. This part is a must part. If we have to choose only 1 goal, I will choose to finish this goal.</p>
  <li>Deliver a complete product</li>
  <p>The other 3 goals are to focus more on the customers-end. This goal is to focus on the product. The product should be completed and tested before being sold. Each robot carries the mission of a smart and responsible assistant that supports and enhances the end-users life to be much better with its functions. </p>
</ol>
<h4>Plans and Progress</h4>
<p>Our project idea has come from Duy Nguyen. He has told us about his story of being hacked and the death of his pets when he was a child. Similarly, we have all suffered from the same problems, we felt the same feelings based on the same experience. After that, Duy Nguyen provided us with his idea. At first, the idea was just about a robot that has several security functions like a firewall, but we felt that the idea was so interesting. We sat back together and brainstormed to get the final idea which is our project idea that we are doing. The idea was developed from an alike firewall robot to a firewall robot that has some extra functions such as database, being compatible with Cloud. The idea kept developing with a keylogger that was added to it, this idea was provided by Hieu. Duy Vuong also recommended that the idea should not just protect the network of the users but also real life. We felt that idea was super interesting so we all agreed. Khai was the last one that came up with the outlooks of the product. As we all suffered from the death of our pets, we could make a digital pet so that it could live longer. After getting all agreements from our group members, we started to plan to do the project.</p>
<p>The project is about a family robot that has two main functions, which are network security and real-life security. The robot’s main role is to protect the owners both online and offline. The robot will have several outlooks so that customers can have various choices. The robot can have an outlook of a dog, a cat, or even a little truck, etc. Each design will have a little extra function such as a dog can dry itself as a real dog, a cat can jump to the upper flat face, a truck can move fast, etc. In order to make the robot run and perform its functions. The robot must have a hardware system and a software system. The hardware of the robot has two subparts the outside part and the inside part. The inside part is the components such as the CPU, the sensors, the components of a firewall, batteries,  the mainboard to link all peripherals, etc. The sensors which were agreed to add were a fire sensor, a motion sensor, and a smoke sensor. The fire sensor would be in charge of detecting the overheating area of the house, the motion sensor would be in charge of detecting the moving objects of the house, the smoke sensor would be in charge of detecting the smoke in the house. The battery is placed at the bottom of the tail so that it can easily be charged. The outside part of the project robot was designed to have  metals, crystals, and carbon. With the real robot, the crystals will be put on the eyes area of a robot where the sensors are placed in order to maximize the distance of the signal for more effective scans. The carbon will take ninety percent of the robot, it will cover all the inside and sensors. The metal will play as connectors(joints) between the carbon components, crystals, and the inside parts. The covers are designed to be waterproof.  The first main function of the robot is the network security function. This robot has all the functions of a firewall so that it can play the role of a firewall independently in the private network or work together with a firewall. It will manage, control, and monitor the inbound and outbound data flow of the network. Besides that, it will use the keylogger concept to store the behaviors of the users or the flows of data to the database for later use and analysis. Moreover, it will apply the three basic steps of security, which are Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption to protect the owner’s private network and private information. Authentication is the process of authenticating a person using passwords, FingerPrint, FaceID, etc. Authorization is the process of verifying the rights of a user to log in to what. Encryption is the process of encrypting the significant information in the database to make it random and unpredictable. The encryption uses the algorithms such as SHA256, AES, RC4, DES, etc. If the robot can detect any problems and issues that it cannot solve. It will notify the owners through a special application which is normally used to manage it to get the confirmation. After the set amount of time without receiving any confirmations, it will directly dial the hotlines such as 113, 114, 115 for Vietnam. The second function is the real-life security function. This function aims to protect the owners’ life, house, and properties. With the ability to connect to smart devices, smart equipment, and smart door, the robot will be able to manage all the devices and the house. If the password of the door is entered incorrectly 5 times in a row, the door will be locked and opened by the physical keys only. While entering the password, the camera on the door will capture the face of that person. If the door is opened incorrectly, the robot will see it as a serious problem and do exactly the same as above. The robot will move around the house and the sensors will perform their mission. The sensors will scan the house to detect the problems. If there are any problems, they will be stored in the database using the keylogger concept and the robot will do exactly the same thing as above, which is dialing the hotlines if it does not get any confirmation from the owners.</p>
<p>The project has been divided into small tasks with detailed requirements, deadlines, and descriptions for each task. We firstly divided the project into two main parts which are software and hardware. </p>
<span>Hardware</span>
<ol>
  <li>Designing the outlook of the product</li>
  <p>This task was the very first task of our project. It was started right after the day the idea had got confirmed. Khai was the one who volunteered to do the task. On Monday of week 9, Khai started to do the task and the deadline was 5 days. He finished designing the project with 2 outlooks which were cat and dog outlooks. Besides that, he drew a schematic diagram of the cover (outside parts) and the mainboards, chips (inside parts). The task was done on time, which was on Friday of week 9. </p>
  <li>Buying  components and materials</li>
  <p>This task was begun after the design part when as on week 9 Saturday. The real robot was supposed to be constructed by carbon, metal, and crystal. At this task, due to the low budget, instead of buying the metal, carbon, and crystal materials and components, we chose to buy the cheaper kits to try doing the prototype. After getting the kits, Duy Nguyen proposed to the other teammates his new idea, which was adding some sensors to the real-life security part. This task was supposed to take 3 days to be completed, which was on Monday. However, on week 10 Monday, we decided to buy sensors, so this task took two days more. Every member of our group did this task.</p>
  <li>Re-designing the robot and constructing components and materials.</li>
  <p>This task was contained two sub-tasks, which were designing the robot again by adding some sensors and constructing the outside part of the robot. Khai was the one who designed the robot again. The rest three teammates were in charge of constructing the components and materials. This task was supposed to last 7 days from week 10 Wednesday to week 11 Wednesday. Each sub-task was a maximum of three and a half days. Due to the low budget, the project robot and the prototype robot had very different materials. The prototype robot was plastic. Although using plastic for the prototype, we also found the toughness of this project to just do the outside part of the hardware of the project. On the first day of doing this task, every team member had a meeting offline and we started building the hardware system. After a few hours, we found that we did not have enough experience and knowledge to follow the design. We gave up at that time. Everyone went home and watched the videos on the Internet to get more knowledge. We sat back together the next day which was on Wednesday of week 11. It took us hours to finish the prototype of the project. The prototype was just about the outside part of the hardware.  This task was also the last task that we did for the hardware part due to the limit of time. There were more tasks that we planned to finish but we could not finish by the end of week 12. The rest of the time, which was from week 11 to the end of week 12, we started to try doing parts of the software.</p>
</ol>
<span>Software</span>
<ol>
  <li>Creating database</li>
  <p>This task started on week 11 Thursday. This task was done by Duy Nguyen and Duy Vuong. They used Mysql and Microsoft Access to try to do the database. Although the real database is much more complex, they tried to do the easier ones. They used Arduino to connect to sensors to receive data and store it in the database. This process was hard for us. It took them to Wednesday of week 12 to finish. The rest of the time they designed the really basic user interface with Khai for the application that managed the robot. The user interface task was not done.</p>
  <li>Coding to setup the security functions</li>
  <p>Duy Nguyen and Hieu Dang from the Thursday of week 12 to the end of week 12 used Packet Tracer to program a Cisco firewall to have an overview of how to set up the security functions to a Router, Switch, or Firewall. This task was not done yet. There were so many tasks to do in this software part. However, we seemed not to have enough time and knowledge to finish it.</p>
