<h2>Team Profile</h2>
<h3>Team Name:</h3> <span> Group 21 </span>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>• My name is Nguyen Hieu Duc Duy, I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I will turn 23 in 2022. My student number is s3930426. I am fluently using Vietnamese and English. I am attracted to computers and games which are the reason for me to take the Bachelor of Information Technology. Besides that, I have a few hobbies to enjoy while I have free time and to reduce stress such as playing cardistry and working out at the gym. I have a special interest in cybersecurity, which was fired up by a hacker who hacked my email years ago. Because I am just a second-year student, I have not had been able to arrange my time to work while studying. However, I am planning to work while studying soon. </p>
<p>• My name is Vuong Quang Duy, and I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City for most of my life, therefore I have grown to have a deep bond with the Vietnam urban cityscape and culture. However, it is important to note that my English skills are developed via exposure to western or foreign culture and media primarily came from television and the Internet, and it has been further enriched during my high school years at the Canadian International School. Thus, now I can speak semi-fluent Vietnamese and English. Throughout the years, my family and peers would often refer to me as an imaginative and adaptable person. And while those two aspects are mostly what I see in myself, I personally think the latter has not been very consistent and hope to improve it at RMIT. My hobbies are primarily creative-based activities such as character drawing, story writing, and building virtual Lego models. I have also been looking into designing games and proper 3D modeling, which is why I have spent time watching tutorials on these hobbies prior to RMIT. While my hobbies and interests do not necessarily have a strict relation to IT, I still hope this course can provide me with valuable information which can aid me in my future pursuits and/or help me make a sustainable living out of my interests. </p>
<p>• My name is Dang Trung Hieu, and I am from Ho Chi Minh city, I was raised in a family with a deep passion for music and instruments. I had always been busy with various musical instruments because my dad wanted me to play each of his favorite instruments. Through time, I had developed a passion for guitar, my all-time favorite. Next, just a few days to my 13th birthday, a friend of mine introduce me to hip-hop, a music genre originally created by the African-American, which shape my vision and thoughts about life until now. After a while, hip-hop is really all I think about, so I start writing music and making music beats on my laptop. After 2 years of making music via my laptop, I start to grow interested in computer science and programming. With the words of encouragement from my grade 12 IT teacher, I decided to make IT become my main major, and put my rap dream back to the storage where I will open after I succeed as an IT technician.</p>
<p>• My name is Bui Quang Khai from Binh Phuoc province. My student number is s3752113. I started studying in Ho Chi Minh city when I was 12 years old. English is my second language, but I still have to practice becoming better at it. I choose the Bachelor of Information Technology because of my interest in computer and game development. My first hobby is playing board games. Not many people enjoy board games these days but collecting them is still one hobby of mine. The second is playing games. I’m not always sitting on a chair and playing games all day but joining the game community is like social networking, you can share the highlight or party with other members is one of the most things I enjoy it. About the future job, I’m not actually thinking about it. My ability to handle work is quite cumbersome so I will choose a freelance job rather than a permanent job. Of course, until I have enough knowledge, I can switch to a permanent job.
</p>
<h3>Group Processes</h3>
<p>In this Assignment 3, we had not reached our full potential because a few major problems had occurred during the process. Our team had encountered some issues due to unequal workload from members, similar to the previous assignment, we had not worked that well as a team. Nguyen Hieu Duc Duy is the most commendable member of our group since he always encourages and reminds the team to focus on the work as well as taking care of the hardest part of the project. In the future, If we had another project with each other again, I want everyone to take responsibility for their part and be more serious with the teamwork, not only that, don't just know to work on your own part only, communicate with other team members for more information and have more chance to help each other. </p>
<h3>Career Plans</h3>
<p>Our team members have all four different ideal jobs, for Duc Duy, his ideal jobs are a cyber security specialist which is a perfect ideal job for his personality, a job that requires reliability and leading skills, and a large amount of system protecting experiences. For Quang Duy, his ideal job is a Unity developer, which is a 2D-3D game developer using an online engine call Unity 3D. Quang Duy’s role is the explorer, not like Duc Duy, a defender that is reliable and sturdy, Quang Duy’s ideal job requires a high amount of creativity that can help the company to have more new and exciting games, luckily, Quang Duy’s role is the explorer, who has a creative and open-mind that like to try new things. I, Trung Hieu, my perfect ideal job is a DevOps, a job that requires both development and operation skills, this job not only requires a person with deep experience with computers and platforms but also a person that knows how to connect people and understand the employee’s feelings. My role is the humanist, which is perfect for the operation part, but I still need to study more to have more experience with computer platforms. Like every other team member in the group, my ideal job is still a job that requires a high amount of interaction with computers and devices, however, I assume that my ideal job is the hardest job to get than anyone in the group. It requires heavy skills in computer platforms and also in planning the project and operating it. Quang Khai’s ideal job is a game developer like Quang Duy, however, Quang Duy’s ideal job requires a person with high experience in the Unity engine, in the other hand, Quang Khai’s ideal job requires a person with creative ideas that can manage and set up the plan for the company. It is quite similar for Duy and Khai, but when looking into the details, the job that they choose is exactly for them, Quang Duy with more experience in computer platforms can fit his job’s requirements, and Quang Khai with the great ability with arrangement can fit with the role of a visioner for his ideal job as a game developer.</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<h4>Topic:</h4>
<p>Our project idea is a combination of the members’ ideas. The product will focus on one of the trendy fields of Information Technology, which is security. Our product can be seen as a smart home assistant. Its main roles are to secure the private network of a family and to secure the owners’ life with its built-in functions. The product will be delivered as a robot with various outlooks and be communicative.
<br>The robot requires the software and hardware to run. The software is various from AI, operating system, security functions, and a compatible app. The hardware should have the components of a firewall with built-in sensors. The software will control the hardware as the other robots and devices, the security functions will perform automatically after being set by owners via an app. AI will analyze the data from sensors and security functions to solve the problems as owners expect
</p>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>
Feeling safety is one of the most important concerns of every creature from animals to humans in the world. People are larger than any other creatures in the demands of safety due to modern society. Feeling secured in daily life is not enough because the Internet is becoming one of the most significant parts of a person’s life. Feeling protected while using the Internet and while living our life is a motivation for us to come up with this idea. The project’s main roles are to make the owners feel as secured as possible in both areas of their life. Our main purpose is to make the customers understand how security is important and how our product helps by giving tutorials on every product to enhance the knowledge of customers. The robot requires the builders to have a large skillset from hardware to software. The robot also needs to run and learn by itself using AI and store things using cloud technologies. The project will show the ability of the product, the effects that it has, and its innovation on the market.
</p>
<h4>Landscape</h4>
<p>
The product is quite unique so there are not really other products that have exactly the same functions as our product. This product is like a combination of the existing products on the market  Cisco firewalls awith smart assistants. The market of this product is not just in the security field but also the AI field so the competitors are the top companies such as Cisco and AI companies. However, the unique part of the product will make it stand out from other existing products in the market. It can protect not just on the network as the Cisco firewall or it will not just focus on just assisting owners as the other assistants such as Alexa. It will show the owners its usefulness in protecting the owners online and offline, and in communicating to the owners smartly. The most significant thing that makes it stand out from other products is it can flexibly secure the owners' network and their devices, equipment, and properties.
</p>
<h3>Detailed Description</h3>
<h4>Aims</h4>
<p>Aim: Enhance the online and offline security system of family non-technical end-users </p>
<p>Security is the most important thing to every creature. It plays a main role in deciding whether a person’s life is good or not. With safety, a person can feel more relaxed and focus more on their life, job, and their daily activities. Without safety, a person’s life can become terrible and be filled with anxiety, nervousness, and pessimistic thoughts.  Rell [1] quoted “At the end of the day, the goals are simple: safety and security”. It is clear that the importance of our security should always be the top priority. After a day, the more secure you are, the better that day you have had. It is no conflict that if you are poor or rich, you should feel safer to enjoy your life in your own ways. Therefore, with this project, we do not just aim to deliver a product but we also aim to provide a better life by providing the customers with knowledge about the robot and knowledge about security. We aim to raise the awareness of customers about the threats, attacks, cyber-threats, and cyber-attacks with several tutorials given by our robot and our team. Kaspersky [2] noted that the most unpredictable and uncontrollable cybersecurity and security factor is human beings. It can be thought of as the best way and factor to secure someone is themselves. Therefore, enhancing knowledge and awareness and combining it with a good security assistant(robot) is our aim for this project.  </p>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Understand the uses of the robot.</li>
  <p>In order to enhance the security system, the very first goal is the use of the robot must be understood well by the customers. After purchasing the robot, the customers will receive a brief description of the robot by our team. Besides that, there is an attached catalog that tells customers all about the uses of a robot and its functions. This is a very basic and first step before using a product.</p>
  <li>Support customers to be familiar with the product</li>
  <p>After explaining the uses of the robot and all the knowledge about the robot, the next step is to practice how to use the robot effectively and efficiently. This step is quite important to customers so that they can directly communicate with the robot. In this step, the customers will get familiar with the robot and see what the robot can actually do when the problems occur. Moreover, the customers will be free to contact the robot until they get confident in controlling and managing the robot. There are also tutorial videos in the repository of the robot that will tutor the customers if they forget. </p>
  <li>Improve the users’ security knowledge and awareness.</li>
  <p>This is the most important goal to achieve the aim. The robot(assistant) will raise the owners’ awareness about security, and how important it is by showing some videos and telling some stories. Besides that, it will provide the basic knowledge of security and cyber-security that were recommended and implemented by the team. An end-user must have the knowledge to protect themselves first before getting protection from others. Therefore, it is significant that the robot and our team have to enhance the knowledge of customers. This part is a must part. If we have to choose only 1 goal, I will choose to finish this goal.</p>
  <li>Deliver a complete product</li>
  <p>The other 3 goals are to focus more on the customers-end. This goal is to focus on the product. The product should be completed and tested before being sold. Each robot carries the mission of a smart and responsible assistant that supports and enhances the end-users life to be much better with its functions. </p>
</ol>
<h4>Plans and Progress</h4>
<p>Our project idea has come from Duy Nguyen. He has told us about his story of being hacked and the death of his pets when he was a child. Similarly, we have all suffered from the same problems, we felt the same feelings based on the same experience. After that, Duy Nguyen provided us with his idea. At first, the idea was just about a robot that has several security functions like a firewall, but we felt that the idea was so interesting. We sat back together and brainstormed to get the final idea which is our project idea that we are doing. The idea was developed from an alike firewall robot to a firewall robot that has some extra functions such as database, being compatible with Cloud. The idea kept developing with a keylogger that was added to it, this idea was provided by Hieu. Duy Vuong also recommended that the idea should not just protect the network of the users but also real life. We felt that idea was super interesting so we all agreed. Khai was the last one that came up with the outlooks of the product. As we all suffered from the death of our pets, we could make a digital pet so that it could live longer. After getting all agreements from our group members, we started to plan to do the project.</p>
<p>The project is about a family robot that has two main functions, which are network security and real-life security. The robot’s main role is to protect the owners both online and offline. The robot will have several outlooks so that customers can have various choices. The robot can have an outlook of a dog, a cat, or even a little truck, etc. Each design will have a little extra function such as a dog can dry itself as a real dog, a cat can jump to the upper flat face, a truck can move fast, etc. In order to make the robot run and perform its functions. The robot must have a hardware system and a software system. The hardware of the robot has two subparts the outside part and the inside part. The inside part is the components such as the CPU, the sensors, the components of a firewall, batteries,  the mainboard to link all peripherals, etc. The sensors which were agreed to add were a fire sensor, a motion sensor, and a smoke sensor. The fire sensor would be in charge of detecting the overheating area of the house, the motion sensor would be in charge of detecting the moving objects of the house, the smoke sensor would be in charge of detecting the smoke in the house. The battery is placed at the bottom of the tail so that it can easily be charged. The outside part of the project robot was designed to have  metals, crystals, and carbon. With the real robot, the crystals will be put on the eyes area of a robot where the sensors are placed in order to maximize the distance of the signal for more effective scans. The carbon will take ninety percent of the robot, it will cover all the inside and sensors. The metal will play as connectors(joints) between the carbon components, crystals, and the inside parts. The covers are designed to be waterproof.  The first main function of the robot is the network security function. This robot has all the functions of a firewall so that it can play the role of a firewall independently in the private network or work together with a firewall. It will manage, control, and monitor the inbound and outbound data flow of the network. Besides that, it will use the keylogger concept to store the behaviors of the users or the flows of data to the database for later use and analysis. Moreover, it will apply the three basic steps of security, which are Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption to protect the owner’s private network and private information. Authentication is the process of authenticating a person using passwords, FingerPrint, FaceID, etc. Authorization is the process of verifying the rights of a user to log in to what. Encryption is the process of encrypting the significant information in the database to make it random and unpredictable. The encryption uses the algorithms such as SHA256, AES, RC4, DES, etc. If the robot can detect any problems and issues that it cannot solve. It will notify the owners through a special application which is normally used to manage it to get the confirmation. After the set amount of time without receiving any confirmations, it will directly dial the hotlines such as 113, 114, 115 for Vietnam. The second function is the real-life security function. This function aims to protect the owners’ life, house, and properties. With the ability to connect to smart devices, smart equipment, and smart door, the robot will be able to manage all the devices and the house. If the password of the door is entered incorrectly 5 times in a row, the door will be locked and opened by the physical keys only. While entering the password, the camera on the door will capture the face of that person. If the door is opened incorrectly, the robot will see it as a serious problem and do exactly the same as above. The robot will move around the house and the sensors will perform their mission. The sensors will scan the house to detect the problems. If there are any problems, they will be stored in the database using the keylogger concept and the robot will do exactly the same thing as above, which is dialing the hotlines if it does not get any confirmation from the owners.</p>
<p>The project has been divided into small tasks with detailed requirements, deadlines, and descriptions for each task. We firstly divided the project into two main parts which are software and hardware. </p>
<span>Hardware</span>
<ol>
  <li>Designing the outlook of the product</li>
  <p>This task was the very first task of our project. It was started right after the day the idea had got confirmed. Khai was the one who volunteered to do the task. On Monday of week 9, Khai started to do the task and the deadline was 5 days. He finished designing the project with 2 outlooks which were cat and dog outlooks. Besides that, he drew a schematic diagram of the cover (outside parts) and the mainboards, chips (inside parts). The task was done on time, which was on Friday of week 9. </p>
  <li>Buying  components and materials</li>
  <p>This task was begun after the design part when as on week 9 Saturday. The real robot was supposed to be constructed by carbon, metal, and crystal. At this task, due to the low budget, instead of buying the metal, carbon, and crystal materials and components, we chose to buy the cheaper kits to try doing the prototype. After getting the kits, Duy Nguyen proposed to the other teammates his new idea, which was adding some sensors to the real-life security part. This task was supposed to take 3 days to be completed, which was on Monday. However, on week 10 Monday, we decided to buy sensors, so this task took two days more. Every member of our group did this task.</p>
  <li>Re-designing the robot and constructing components and materials.</li>
  <p>This task was contained two sub-tasks, which were designing the robot again by adding some sensors and constructing the outside part of the robot. Khai was the one who designed the robot again. The rest three teammates were in charge of constructing the components and materials. This task was supposed to last 7 days from week 10 Wednesday to week 11 Wednesday. Each sub-task was a maximum of three and a half days. Due to the low budget, the project robot and the prototype robot had very different materials. The prototype robot was plastic. Although using plastic for the prototype, we also found the toughness of this project to just do the outside part of the hardware of the project. On the first day of doing this task, every team member had a meeting offline and we started building the hardware system. After a few hours, we found that we did not have enough experience and knowledge to follow the design. We gave up at that time. Everyone went home and watched the videos on the Internet to get more knowledge. We sat back together the next day which was on Wednesday of week 11. It took us hours to finish the prototype of the project. The prototype was just about the outside part of the hardware.  This task was also the last task that we did for the hardware part due to the limit of time. There were more tasks that we planned to finish but we could not finish by the end of week 12. The rest of the time, which was from week 11 to the end of week 12, we started to try doing parts of the software.</p>
</ol>
<span>Software</span>
<ol>
  <li>Creating database</li>
  <p>This task started on week 11 Thursday. This task was done by Duy Nguyen and Duy Vuong. They used Mysql and Microsoft Access to try to do the database. Although the real database is much more complex, they tried to do the easier ones. They used Arduino to connect to sensors to receive data and store it in the database. This process was hard for us. It took them to Wednesday of week 12 to finish. The rest of the time they designed the really basic user interface with Khai for the application that managed the robot. The user interface task was not done.</p>
  <li>Coding to setup the security functions</li>
  <p>Duy Nguyen and Hieu Dang from the Thursday of week 12 to the end of week 12 used Packet Tracer to program a Cisco firewall to have an overview of how to set up the security functions to a Router, Switch, or Firewall. This task was not done yet. There were so many tasks to do in this software part. However, we seemed not to have enough time and knowledge to finish it.</p>
</ol>
<h4>Roles</h4>
  <p>Due to our current team size, an individual member will most likely take up two or more roles in the team to save time and increase efficiency. Therefore, the following list of roles is subject to change either in a role’s sole responsibility or the number of available roles:</p>
  <p><u>Leader:</u> Duy Nguyen will be responsible for overseeing the entire development process, directing the team members in regards to functionality and design.</p>
  <p><u>QA Tester:</u> Quang Duy will be responsible for testing the project’s functionality and quality to check if there are any issues or bugs that need to be fixed.</p>
  <p><u>Hardware Designer/Engineer:</u> Khai will be responsible for designing the physical and mechanical hardware aspects of the project.</p>
  <p><u>AI Developer:</u> Quang Duy will be responsible for programming the AI function for the robot.</p>
  <p><u>Database developer:</u> Duy Nguyen will be responsible for creating the database and user interfaces.</p>
  <p><u>Software designer:</u> Hieu Dang and Quang Duy will be responsible for designing the software.</p>
<h4>Scope and Limits</h4>
<p>With a projected time limit of sixteen weeks, we aim to accomplish and test all of the robot’s primary features and ensure that it is fully functional, all within our projected timeframe. That being said, due to the size of our team (as of the time of writing), several members will most likely be handling the same task, which would demand communication and cooperative work ethics on top of a clear grasp of the Github interface. Not only that, it is ideal that no new grand features will be added to our robot other than the primary ones, to completely prevent the “scope creep” phenomenon from ever happening.</p>
<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
<p>Basically, in roder to build a robot, it requires both hardware and software. With this project, the hardware of the robot is various from chips, peripherals,  sensors, batteries, etc.and the outside part of the robot to cover the main stuff inside. The cover will be metals, carbon, and crystals. The software is also variou from database, applications to simulate the functions such as WebBot. Besides that, applications to design user interface or an application such as Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, etc. The applications to do AI such as Robot A.I Maker.Duy Nguyen has experience on the program the security function for the network. He has the CCNA certification. He used to program a small private network of a company.
</p>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>Testing is an important part of a project. It supports developers to know whether the product is on the right path or has the right functions. Testing should be done after finishing each small task. Then, when we combine the small tasks together, we should perform the testing part again. Each task will have a different way of testing. In our project, we tested when we finished the hardware outside part. We tested its durability by putting a small pressure on it. Besides that, we compare the product to the sketch to see whether it matches or it needs anything to improve. If two requirements are finished, the test will be successful. Moreover, in order to know whether the testing part is successful, we have to compare the results of the test to the requirements of the task.  </p>

<h4>Risks</h4>
<p>During the implementation of the project on security robots, we also encountered many risks many times. This delays the completion of the project and makes it difficult for the members to carry out this project.</p>
<p>The first problem is the internet connection, in the past few days, we have encountered many times the delay in the network connection leading to unfavorable communication, especially during the covid-19 season, we cannot meet face-to-face. Not only that, but the network connection problems also make using online applications difficult. We encountered cases when using the program such as unresponsiveness or broken connection.</p>
<p>The second problem is creating products. The firewall router is using artificial intelligence to scan and analyze the data that is believed to be suspicious and notify the user. However, to be able to analyze it, it is necessary to have data of viruses that have appeared and solutions to deal with those viruses. This makes it quite difficult for us because this data comes from network security companies, and it takes a long time to accept the use of such data.</p>
<h4>Group Processes and Communications</h4>
<p>	The group began to gather at the Facebook messenger added by Duy Nguyen. He started talking about assignments and divided the parts for each member. On the 6th week, the group arranged to meet online for a face-to-face meeting, but Quang Khai was absent due to a local power outage, so he will be given the details of his work. In the 8th week, 3 members met at RMIT connect and discussed the presentation, and shared the work with the members. Particularly Quang Khai will be talked about later because he is far from the city and still completes his part for the group. Starting with Assignment 3, Duy Nguyen has begun to divide the parts for members. But despite overlapping assignments from other groups, local network problems and frequent meeting interruptions, everyone still tried to fulfill their job responsibilities.

<h2>Skils and Jobs</h2>
<p>As a project manager, I need members that know how to work as a team and also have passion for this field. Don’t slow down other people's work or take responsibility for your actions are those basic rules that everyone needs to follow. Besides that, there are many specific requirements for my members since I want to finish this project nicely and on time. For the 4 individuals that will be in my group, there will be different tasks and jobs for each member to accomplish. Our project is about a firewall that can pair with most of the software nowadays to improve and upgrade people's living space. Therefore, the first member I want to take in my team needs to be a cybersecurity expert, because the core of this project is about protection and security so a cybersecurity specialist would be an essential choice for this project. Second is a member that can see the value in this project, who can see its utilities and the amount of profit it can bring. Not only that, this member needs to study carefully about the ideal market and customer for this project so that we can discuss and negotiate with the venture capitalists. Because our product can be paired with other smart home software, we need a member who is a programmer that has experience with software and hardware connection to help the group take care of the software linking part. The last position I would like to have in my team for this project is a mechanics/design engineer to finalize the process of this project by making this project different from others' smart assistants. We decided to make this product have a friendly design so the users can have more interaction with the assistant than only voices like others.

<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
<h4>Duy Nguyen</h4>
<p>At the end of assignment 3, all the work of our group has been done successfully. We have spent days and weeks working together as a group. We all did show our passion, our excitement while doing the assignment, and our project. The best thing that I saw in this assignment was everyone is so active and responsible for their tasks. I will say that we need to improve our knowledge for our next projects so that we can achieve it successfully. With the low conditions such as low budget, limits of time and resources, we did not give up on doing the project. We at least finished the prototype surprisingly, I was feeling really happy with the attitudes of my team members. I have learned that with a good and responsible team, your status will always be at your top. Github is very useful in helping to manage the tasks by using the commit section. If we commit the tasks well, they will be cleared for everyone and will be easier to manage.</p>
<h4>Khai</h4>
<p>Over the past few days, I've been working on assignments from my team members. I often think too much which leads to difficulties in my homework, but the members try to help each other. The whole team was busy with assignments from other subjects, but they all managed to complete them. In communication, I also give my opinion on the assignment with the team. What surprised me was that the team leader arranged to divide the parts to make the members even and give ideas for the assignment. What I've learned from my team is to schedule time to work. They divide the parts to do first and then to do later. Then briefly review the part that needs to be corrected as well as add comments for that part. Getting to know GitHub is also a bit difficult because I often forget the details to work with. GitHub makes it possible for the team to update information and manage the team's files.

<h4>Duy Vuong</h4>
<p>For the past few weeks, working on multiple group projects has been mentally exhausting for me as my confidence in grasping the subject matter diminished by each passing week, leaving me concerned about how far behind I am at my assignment and disappointed of how little communication I have had with my teammates. Due to my focus shifting to other concurrent group projects, I have had a questionable understanding of what my project is in essence and what are its primary functions. And while my peers do have a comparatively clearer understanding of the project’s concepts, I still suspect that they too have understood the assignment as much as I did, thus explaining certain aspects such as appearance and applied technology are not fully realized. Despite the aforementioned complications regarding the project’s functionalities and communication, I still think that the occasions our team conversed with each other have been resourceful in elaborating to me what the project is in essence and left me with a good impression of each individual. And once the team did get the chance to meet in person (except for one member due to a local power outage), we worked together to make the presentation go as smoothly as possible. And thus during and after the project presentation, I have gained more experience working with others in RMIT, with only one regret being my inactivity during group conversations.

<h4>Hieu</h4>
<p>Our member’s past few weeks had been rough since it is the end of the semester so everyone had a lot of assignments to take care of, causing the work distribution of each individual unequal. However, every member has tried their best to contribute to the team even if they have their personal problems. If we have a chance to improve ourselves, I think the group members should try to communicate with each other more so that everyone can help each other. From the beginning to the end, the thing that surprised me the most is that we still can finish every assignment nicely and on time, but the most important thing is that I’m glad no one has given up. Being through 2 assignments with this group, I learned that we should prepare for unexpected situations, with preparation, we could handle every problem that occurs during the process. Although we can’t meet everybody in the team, we can see most of our teammates in person and have small chats with them about our path as SSET students, and how everybody plans to achieve their dream. It is not a perfect group, but we learned a lot from each other.</p>
<h4>As the whole group</h4>
<p>As a group, we all have to improve ourselves more so that we can help each other and be more connected. We all have our mistakes and issues that need to be resolved as an individual but therefore, it will create a better link between our members just by developing yourself, as a group, help yourself means help the team since you already had the experience to deal with your problems and you can use that to support others. By being in the same group, everyone had tried their best not to slow down the process of this project and also avoid wasting other members' time. But while partaking in this assignment has been invaluable for developing future work ethics, we as a group has yet to effectively communicate at a more consistent rate. Through the process of working with the group, we gradually improve the arrangement of assignment time and work in groups more effectively. This helps us know how to divide the time properly to do the assignment and enough to change and edit the details in the assignment. The group did a good job in dividing the work pieces reasonably as well as giving appropriate ideas for their work. Not only that, but this also helps the members' relationship to become better when working and communicating. We have also accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience when working in a group, knowledge in regards of development principles and technology applications. It is in the true essence of software/hardware development that we could get a constant flow of new ideas and applications through researching and implementing multiple different technologies, which is why searching for solutions from credible sources should be second nature for an average developer, which our group certainly have done throughout the assignment. That being said, knowing what and where to research can only help us for so much before we have to come up with our own methodologies and figure out the inner logics to bridge the technology and features so that no conflicts could occur. The attitude of the group is increasing day by day until the end of the semester. The group has also created a really strong bond. We have learned, played, talked and felt happy while we were doing the project together. Although there were challenges, we all had to overcome the others. At the end of this semester, we also provided our hard work with happiness, proudness and our end-product. Everyone in the group tried their best to achieve the group's goals and tasks so that all of the memories and knowledge will reside in each member for the future.
