Our product can be seen as a smart home assistant. Its main roles are to secure the private network of a family and to secure the owners’ life with its built-in functions. The product will be delivered as a robot with various outlooks and be communicative.
<br>The robot requires the software and hardware to run. The software is various from AI, operating system, security functions, and a compatible app. The hardware should have the components of a firewall with built-in sensors. The software will control the hardware as the other robots and devices, the security functions will perform automatically after being set by owners via an app. AI will analyze the data from sensors and security functions to solve the problems as owners expect

<h4>Motivation</h4>
Feeling safety is one of the most important concerns of every creature from animals to humans in the world. People are larger than any other creatures in the demands of safety due to modern society. Feeling secured in daily life is not enough because the Internet is becoming one of the most significant parts of a person’s life. Feeling protected while using the Internet and while living our life is a motivation for us to come up with this idea. The project’s main roles are to make the owners feel as secured as possible in both areas of their life. Our main purpose is to make the customers understand how security is important and how our product helps by giving tutorials on every product to enhance the knowledge of customers. The robot requires the builders to have a large skillset from hardware to software. The robot also needs to run and learn by itself using AI and store things using cloud technologies. The project will show the ability of the product, the effects that it has, and its innovation on the market.

<h4>Landscape</h4>
The product is quite unique so there are not really other products that have exactly the same functions as our product. This product is like a combination of the existing products on the market  Cisco firewalls awith smart assistants. The market of this product is not just in the security field but also the AI field so the competitors are the top companies such as Cisco and AI companies. However, the unique part of the product will make it stand out from other existing products in the market. It can protect not just on the network as the Cisco firewall or it will not just focus on just assisting owners as the other assistants such as Alexa.
