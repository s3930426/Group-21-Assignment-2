        <h3>Team Name:</h3><span> Team 21</span>
          <p></p>
        <h3>Personal Information</h3>

          <p>My name is Nguyen Hieu Duc Duy, I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I will turn 23 in 2022. My student number is s3930426. I am fluently using Vietnamese and English. I am attracted to computers and games which are the reason for me to take the Bachelor of Information Technology. Besides that, I have a few hobbies to enjoy while I have free time and to reduce stress such as playing cardistry and working out at the gym. I have a special interest in cybersecurity ,which was fired up by a hacker who hacked my email years ago. Because I am just a second-year student, I have not had been able to arrange my time to work while studying. However, I am planning to work while studying soon.  </p>

          <p>My name is Vuong Quang Duy, and I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City for most of my life, therefore I have grown to have a deep bond with the Vietnam urban cityscape and culture. However, it is important to note that my English skills are developed via exposure to western or foreign culture and media primarily came from television and Internet, and it has been further enriched during my high school years at the Canadian International School. Thus, now I can speak semi-fluent Vietnamese and English. Throughout the years, my family and peers would often refer to me as an imaginative and adaptable person. And while those two aspects are mostly what I see in myself, I personally think the latter has not been very consistent and hope to improve it at RMIT. My hobbies are primarily creative based activities such as character drawing, story writing, and building virtual Lego models. I have also been looking into designing games and proper 3D modelling, which is why I have spent time watching tutorials on these hobbies prior to RMIT. While my hobbies and interests do not necessarily have a strict relation to IT, I still hope this course can provide me valuable information which can aid me in my future pursuits and/or help me make a sustainable living out of my interests. </p>

          <p> My name is Dang Trung Hieu, and I am from Ho Chi Minh city, I was raised in a family with a deep passion for music and instruments. I had always been busy with various musical instruments because my dad wanted me to play each of his favorite instruments. Through time, I had developed a passion for guitar, my all-time favorite. Next, just a few days to my 13th birthday, a friend of mine introduce me to hip-hop, a music genre originally created by the African-American, which shape my vision and thoughts about life until now. After a period of time, hip-hop is really all I think about, so I start writing music and making music beats on my laptop. After 2 years of making music via my laptop, I start to grow interested in computer science and programming. With the words of encouragement from my grade 12 IT teacher, I decided to make IT become my main major, and put my rap dream back to the storage where I will open after I succeed as an IT technician. </p>

          <p>My name is Bui Quang Khai from Binh Phuoc province. My student number is s3752113. I started studying in Ho Chi Minh city when I was 12 years old. English is my second language, but I still have to practice becoming better at it. I choose the Bachelor of Information Technology because of the interest in computer and game development. My first hobbies are playing board games. Not many people enjoy board games these days but collecting them is still one hobby of mine. The second is playing games. I’m not always sitting on a chair and playing games all day but joining the game community is like social networking, you can share the highlight or party with other members is one of the most things I enjoy it. About the future job, I’m not actually thinking about it. My ability to handle work is quite cumbersome so I will choose a freelance job rather than a permanent job. Of course, until I have enough knowledge, I can switch to a permanent job. </p>

        <h3>Team Profile</h3>

          <p>How these tests help us to manage the team: At first glance, our team’s members all have the unique traits that form our personalities, we all have our distinguish role with both advantages and disadvantages. With the result from the 3 tests, they help us to distribute the jobs and requirements for each member, allowing us to have the job that is also our advantage. Duc Duy’s role is the defender, a role that is known for the sturdiness and the power to lead everyone, so we decided to let him be the leader. Quang Duy’s role is the explorer, a role that is known for bravery and curiosity, a perfect role for the interview job. For myself, Trung Hieu, my role is the humanist, a role that is known for the empathy and understanding of human’s relationships, my role is fit perfectly for the jobs of connecting everyone and helping the members to overcome their issues. Quang Khai’s role is logistician, a role that is known for carefulness and logical thinking, a perfect role to do jobs like revision and arranging information. Our group decided to let Khai be the reviser and let him take care of the arrangement.  </p>

        <h3>Ideal Jobs</h3>
          <p>Our team members have all four different ideal jobs, for Duc Duy, his ideal jobs are a cyber security specialist which is a perfect ideal job for his personality, a job that requires reliability and leading skills, and a large amount of system protecting experiences. For Quang Duy, his ideal job is a Unity developer, which is a 2D-3D game developer using an online engine call Unity 3D. Quang Duy’s role is the explorer, not like Duc Duy, a defender that is reliable and sturdy, Quang Duy’s ideal job requires a high amount of creativity that can help the company to have more new and exciting games, luckily, Quang Duy’s role is the explorer, who has a creative and open-mind that like to try new things. I, Trung Hieu, my perfect ideal job is a DevOps, a job that requires both development and operation skills, this job not only requires a person with deep experience with computers and platforms but also a person that knows how to connect people and understand the employee’s feeling. My role is the humanist, which is perfect for the operation part, but I still need to study more to have more experience with computer platforms. Quang Khai’s ideal job is a game developer like Quang Duy, however, Quang Duy’s ideal job requires a person with high experience in the Unity engine, in the other hand, Quang Khai’s ideal job requires a person with creative ideas that can manage and set up the plan for the company. It is quite similar for Duy and Khai, but when looking into the details, the job that they choose is exactly for them, Quang Duy with more experience in computer platforms can fit his job’s requirements, and Quang Khai with the great ability with arrangement can fit with the role of a visioner for his ideal job as a game developer.  </p>

        <h3>Cybersecurity and privacy </h3>
          <p>The Internet has been growing speedy since the 2000s. Some several technological developments and changes change the whole world such as social media, smartphones, cryptocurrencies, cloud services, AR/VR, artificial intelligence, etc. The whole world is being computerized. Using the Internet helps people to catch up with the world and get easier to contact others. However, the rapid development causes unbalance between how to use and how to secure the Internet. The lack of cyber security knowledge can lead to loss, being attacked, and not having privacy, which indirectly helps the cybersecurity major to be developed. Therefore, what is cybersecurity? What does exactly cybersecurity do? Security is a term of protecting against criminal activities, danger, damage, and loss. The term cybersecurity is hard to clearly define because it is broadly used, highly variable, and uninformative, which is stated by Craigen et al. [1]. However, it can be understood as the processes and policies to protect the information, privacy, and data on private and public networks, systems, local servers, databases, and many other aspects of the Internet. Moreover, Kaspersky [2] reported that people are the most unpredictable cybersecurity factor. It is clear that not just the protection of hardware, software, and electrical devices are covered in the term cybersecurity but also the people need to be enhanced their knowledge of protecting themselves. As the threats and cyber-attacks have been growing since the 2000s, the demands of being secured while using the Internet has been also growing. Cybersecurity has been invested, studied, and developed for decades. Everything which is connected to the Internet nowadays is mostly secured by one of the most recent and basic processes with three factors authentication, authorization, and encryption. Authentication is to clarify that person is the exact one. Authorization goes after authentication; it clarifies the rights of that authenticated person. Encryption is to enhance the security of information such as passwords and secret information in the database. With the current technology, there are various types of authentications. Instead of entering passwords to authenticate, Fingerprint, Face ID, and Eyes scanning are being applied to authenticate. Besides that, there is not just one algorithm or way to encrypt data, there are many types of algorithms being developed such as Triple DES, SHA 256, RSA, MD5, etc. With the rapid development of cybersecurity, security hardware and third-party applications have been also developed. The firewall is one of the security hardware mentioned above, it is at the third layer of the TCP/IP model. Its main functions are to control and secure the inbounds and outbounds of a private network. Nowadays, operating systems such as Windows, IOS, macOS, etc. provide their security functions but there are also several security applications such as McAfee, BKAV, Kaspersky, etc. to enhance the protection of devices. All the technologies listed above are the current technologies, which help users to reduce times of cyber-attacks locally and globally and be able to solve the issues remotely. The world is developing AI to enhance cybersecurity but there are several conflicts about its advantages and disadvantages. Vyas [3] reported that AI in cybersecurity can process large volumes of data, have greater adaptability, early detection of cybersecurity risks, etc. Vyas [3] also reported that the advantages of AI can also benefit hackers, breach of privacy, higher cost, uncontrollable, etc. It is clear that AI in cybersecurity can bring benefits and have several downsides. Goud [4] reported that if the AI in cybersecurity had not been controlled, it could have been spelled doom in 2024. Therefore, AI can be seen as a future cybersecurity technology and predicted to develop in the future.
          <br><br>
          In this computerized world, the development in cybersecurity can impact the whole world. Every job, every organization will be affected. From hospitals to businesses and education systems, from IT pros to normal end-users will be directly and indirectly affected. If AI is developed in cybersecurity, it will help cybersecurity specialists to reduce their volumes of work. AI can be seen as a useful assistant to support users. Cybersecurity specialists will be the most affected if AI takes place in cybersecurity areas. There are pros and cons. People who study cybersecurity as a major will have to study knowledge about AI as an assistant. Besides that, the way, method, or process at work will be differentiated, there may be a new model of working which would be AI-human combination Vyas [3] stated.  Moreover, the volumes of work will be reduced much and if the volumes of work are reduced, which will lead to reducing the demands of recruitment in this area. In contrast, the AI developers recruited demands will be increased, which can lead to the rapid growth of the AI area, the change in the way of educating about AI. The development is also a good idea for normal end-users if AI is built-in firewalls or routers, which leads to the home-network security and privacy will be strengthened. Instead of having just operating systems defender applications, third-party applications, and firewalls at home to secure private networks, there is 1 more additional method that is more intelligent, controllable, and useful in managing all the other 3 methods.
          <br><br>
          The role of cybersecurity and privacy is getting more significant. The more it is developed, the better life people will have. Imagine that we are surfing the Internet to relax after a tiring day, and then we received a notification that our information gets leaked, scammed, and hacked just because of links we just clicked. That would be a disaster to our mental and physical health. Therefore, we need to secure ourselves to be relaxed while using the Internet. My bank information got leaked once, I lost all of my money, but the bank and the cyber police helped me to get back what I lost. Therefore, I knew that without having cybersecurity, my life would not have been great. The development of cybersecurity will provide me with more attraction as I am interested in a cybersecurity major. Besides that, I will have more knowledge about cybersecurity so that I can protect myself from being cyber-attacks. I may help myself and my family to have good relaxing times on social media or on the Internet with limited concerns about the safety and the danger of the links, emails, or messages in my daily life. Having a really relaxing time after a tiring day by using the Internet can help people to recover their mental health and reduce stress. Moreover, people can be more productive on the next day which will increase the life quality of families and the entire country. </p>

        <h3>Robots</h3>
          <p>Robot is a machine that is set up and controlled by a computer to perform basic human actions up to those that require its ability. In 1920, The original word “Robot” came from Mr. Karel Capek was a famous Czechoslovakian dramatist in his work, “Rossum’s Universal Robots”. Since then, Robots are just like moving dolls or animations in a scientific movie until they found how robots are useful in society and industries. Robots can represent humans to perform many dangerous tasks that are difficult for humans to access or implement due to the complex environment [5]. With the rapid of technology and the ability of robots to bring, they are divided into different branches for each specific task and ability. For example:  In industrial plants, Robot is used as a jointed aim connected via control panels to receive commands and perform tasks. With autonomous capabilities, robots can do basic things from grasping, delivering, and assembling large parts like a car to complex parts like small computer chips. In Agriculture, Robots are used in tasks such as harvesting crops, sowing seasonal seeds, and analyzing weather checks. Through the camera and control panel, farmers can use them as a support tool in farming, controlling the amount of fertilizer being spread on the soil. Agricultural robot applications are widely used in countries with strong agriculture and agricultural output will be greatly increased. In Agriculture, Robots are used in tasks such as harvesting crops, sowing seasonal seeds, and analyzing weather. Through the camera and control panel, farmers can use them as a support tool in farming and control the amount of fertilizer spread on the land. The use of agricultural robots will create huge opportunities: better and more diversified agricultural products, greater availability, cheaper prices on the world market. In the future, Robots will be developed and widely used in all markets, simplifying tasks that humans do not need to touch. There have been many projects launched such as the ability to automatically drive cars, create humanoid robots to service customers in catering restaurants or automatically deliver to specific locations. For the robot to work effectively in different environments, engineers use AI (Artificial Intelligence). AI represents the intelligence of devices and robots. Through programming from engineers, AI will receive commands and do what is pre-programmed
          <br><br>
          The positive potential of robotics technology is enormous in the modern world. In daily life, the benefits of robots through the ability to work extremely easily thanks to typical supporting devices such as smart homes. Faced with labor resources, this will save businesses time and money thanks to low-cost automation in production lines. In the medical industry, robots can handle situations such as observing a patient's condition, and the flexibility of surgical robots makes surgery smooth and reduces damage to patients. Although the benefits of robots are enormous, their influence also affects the unemployment rate, many traditional industries, productions, and businesses will also disappear quickly, and it will replace most of the workers. This makes people adapt to automation in daily life.
          <br><br>
          With the automation of robots, it can be said that my normal life is quite easy. Although my family is traditional and has little use for technology devices. Its convenience makes life so much easier. However, because of the complexity of the features of robotic devices, it was also difficult for my parents to understand how it works because they did not grasp the rapid technological change like our younger generations. </p>

        <h3>Small Computing Device </h3>
          <p>Arduino, Raspberry PI, Makey Makey, and other small computing devices all serve the same purpose of being open-source programmable tools for interactive creations, providing a functional operating system to code programs or even import software. Not only that, but they are also designed for other projects that go beyond self-contained programs on the module, providing ports to apply circuitry and mechanisms (of varying complexity) which is comprised of drive motors, LEDs (Light Emitting Diode), sensors, and other components. Thus, this technology provides more than just technical applications but also an accessible creative medium with the only practical prerequisites being basic understanding of computer science and mathematics. Such is the example of the Arduino microcontroller, specifically designed to cater for a non-technical audience, giving them the ability to use and manipulate open-sourced computational hardware inexpensively easily thus making it ideal to be customized for art, education, and other media formats [StoA].
            <br><br>
            As of 2021, there have been variants of commercially available small computing devices that while offer an operating system and flexibility in application, differ from each other in terms of programming language, primary features, and flexibility in inverted correspondence to how simple the basic microcontroller design is. The Makey Makey [MM] microcontroller primarily caters to children by their simplistic designs and setup, with its official website featuring beginner projects such as custom keyboards and/or sensors that can be coded using Scratch [S], an online block-based visual coding tool of equivalent beginner-friendly appeal. Meanwhile Microbit [Mc], while sharing similarities with Makey Makey’s visual programming format and general simplistic design that directly appeals to a younger audience, provides a wider array of hardware features built into the microcontroller itself and more coding language to provide a wider array of customizability and manipulation from the programmer. But as these microcontrollers provide more features to allow customization, the programming and component setup process will be more complex too due to the user having more options, as seen with Arduino being virtually applicable with various third-party hardware and same goes for Raspberry PI with the addition of a default functional computer [R].
            <br><br>
            Due to the flexible nature of these small computing devices in terms of design and functionality, what these devices can do mostly depends on what its consumers can do with them. If beginners are ready to approach complex projects which children-oriented microcontrollers like Makey Makey and Microbit [Mc] are not capable of handling, they can move on to more complex hardware and complex programming format to have more customizability. And even if there were any default limitations on the average advanced small computing devices such as Arduino and Raspberry PI, there will often be a third-party hardware commercially available to utilize as a workaround for these limitations. That being the case, there have been hints provided by co-founder of Raspberry PI Eben Upton at the 2021 tinyML Summit regarding “the future of PI Silicon,” upgrades for the hardware’s default machine learning aspects, with the help of several other hardware components made by partnered companies [3y].
            <br><br>
            As aforementioned, the main appeal of these small computing devices lies in their versatility and commercial accessibility which was heavily pushed by recognizable brands such as Raspberry PI. Founded in 2009, the Raspberry PI Foundation’s main goal is to promote the study of computer science in schools, thus they launched their first microcontroller model which immediately gained popularity due to its functionality posing it as a PC (personal computers) replacement despite only cost $1.33 in its initial release [Model 1]. It has gained popularity amongst hobbyists and eventually businesses [Model 1], thus setting the foundation to be on track with its goal of popularizing computer science and continue to develop on its iconic hardware since.
            <br><br>
            With the idea of popularizing computer science and garnering a wider audience being the core goal behind these small computing devices, it is to be expected that the application of these devices will make way into optimizing modern life or will be the building blocks of a new and more refined system. As is the case with Arduino and its official Project Hub featuring a consistently updating project catalogue that focuses on improving quality of life, particularly within healthcare related topics. Currently these topics primarily feature devices for preventing contraction and spread of Covid-19, such as automatic hand sanitizers and proximity alarms for social distancing, but there are also other featured general healthcare projects such as heart monitors, oximeters, etc... [Health] The existence of this thriving sector in a community of hobbyists of different professions meant the convergence of computer science and healthcare can be accessed via one of the most flexible and customizable hardware that is commercially available, providing easy health diagnosis and monitoring hopefully without the need for expensive medical equipment. The same could be said of other discussed topics on Arduino’s official Project Hub with most of them focusing on recreating functionalities of expensive hardware at a much lower cost regardless of its purpose being recreational or serves a vital function in upkeeping quality of life, which is the sole intent of these small computer devices: being cheap and accessible for everyone [Project Hub Ard]. The same could be said of Raspberry PI, but with the addition of a built-in computer and operating system meant that the microcontroller can also serve as a platform for creating self-contained software, which only further broadened the customization to both internal and external [Project Hub PI].
            <br><br>
            With regards to how I have primarily approached this technology both academically and in my own time, it was either for recreational purposes or looking for an inexpensive makeshift replacement for usually expensive hardware. And while as of time of writing I do not have any need to implement microcontrollers into my daily life, I can certainly see its benefits as a DIY general house surveillance system. Considering my family primarily consists of members of the older and more immunocompromised demographic, their wellbeing during the widespread pandemic is a concern I have daily, therefore setting up microcontroller-based monitoring systems that keeps check of their body temperature and/or dust would be helpful [Project Hub Ard]. Other applications for housekeeping could be an alarm for ajar doors or when living quarters got too much exposure to direct sunlight, but as of now my interest in implementing small computing devices is heavily recreational and/or impactful to my creativity drive. I want to take on devices like Arduino or Raspberry PI as a creative medium and use them to express my physical ideas, or at least attempt to recreate interesting projects done on YouTube [YT] with my own take on them. Either way, for now I can see microcontrollers leaving a considerable impact on me both as a creative medium and as a life-saving device which I hope to explore and modify more when the time comes. </p>

        <h3>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies </h3>
          <p>So, what are cryptocurrencies? Cryptocurrencies are virtual currencies that are not supervised or monitored by governments. Individuals and groups used this currency privately and outside of the country’s market laws and policies. To manage and maintain cryptocurrencies, there are many new technologies and methods given out by the new crypto companies and teams that can be promised to make their projects long-lasting on the market. However, for crypto to grow like today, there is a technology that is considered as the base and the core for crypto to work, and that is blockchain. To talk about blockchain, we need to have a little information about the history of cryptocurrency. It was all started by a man named David Chaum, he was an American cryptographer that created the first cryptographic system call eCash in 1984 and another system call DigiCash 12 years later which set the base for the age of crypto. But until 2008, there is no actual virtual coin was being fully developed, so in 2008, a mysterious man known as Satoshi Nakamoto had outlined his virtual coin project on white paper, and in 2009, he releases the first virtual coin that exist and were able to exchange and trade. The coin Satoshi Nakamoto created has gone a long way to achieving many goals that nobody can imagine, his creation had affected the world’s trading market so much that it could potentially give birth to a new era where people use cryptocurrencies as their normal currency in daily lives to exchange for goods, and his creation name is Bitcoin. For Bitcoin to become so popular as today, as I mentioned above, blockchain is the main factor that can help to maintain the existence of not only Bitcoin but also many later coins. So, what really is blockchain? Blockchain is a dispersed database that records all of the transactions in any peer-to-peer network. The special thing about blockchain is that the member can verify their transactions without the requirement for a central clearing authority if they use this technology, not only that, fund transfers, trade settlements, voting, and a variety of other difficulties are all possible uses if using blockchain. Blockchain and Bitcoin have run and grown for 12 years since their debut day. In 2009, 1 Bitcoin was not even worth a dollar, but right now, after 12 years, 1 Bitcoin has worth about $46,500. For blockchain, a chain of blocks that contain information has grown so much that millions of new blocks were being added to the system and creating a bigger, more interesting community. Currently, besides direct trading and exchanging, people had made 2 new sub-majors for cryptocurrency, NFTs and Metaverse. So, what are NFTs? NFTs is a short name for non-fungible tokens, and it was widely used back at the end of 2020. To make it easier to understand, NFTs are tokens that cannot be imitated and exist on a blockchain. It is used to represent real-world properties like artwork, the most famous form of NFTs right now. To talk about metaverse, this is a new concept created by the founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg. Mark said that metaverse will become the future of online trading and entertainment, to access the metaverse, people will need to use AR/VR technology to be in a virtual world where they can use cryptocurrencies for trading, shopping, and playing virtual games. Right now, the metaverse is still in the stage of development, so for it to be used by everyone, Mark’s teams need at least 2-3 years to fully develop it. To make metaverse possible, the growth in participation and popularity of NFTs and cryptocurrencies are the main keys for metaverse to be widely used by everyone after it is released.
            <br><br>
            The development of crypto and blockchain has had a huge impact on the world’s trading market after years of development. Participants in the crypto community were all affected by the rise of Bitcoin. There are 3 main groups of people who will get affected by crypto, and that will be traders, holders, and whales. Traders are people who usually trade their crypto with another participant, and they trade their crypto continuously based on the rise and fall of the market. To be a trader, you need to have a lot of experience in trading and know-how to predict the trend of Bitcoin, by that you will get ahead of almost everyone and have a good trade. Traders will get affected the most since they must deal with the rapidly changing market all the time, not only the market but traders also need to deal with the whales too. The whales are the big fishes in the market, they are the rich, the high-class that want to manipulate the market with their own money. Normally, to get the participants to invest in a coin to make its value go up, the whales will create the hype and make everyone believe that the coin will potentially go skyrocket and they can make a lot of money out of it. But life is never easy, the whales put their huge amount of money into the coin only to trick people to put a lot of money into it, then the whales will withdraw their huge amount of money to achieve their purposes. People that follow the hype will eventually lose their money, the more they put into it, the more they lose. Whales are the nightmare of the participants but also a fairy that can grant wishes, if you are experienced enough, you will know how to take advantage out of the hype created by the whales. The last group of people that get affected by crypto are the holders, the holders will get the least affected because they are the ones who receive the least risk since they don’t have to worry about the rapidly changing market. Instead of that, they just have to buy their favorite coins and believe it will go up in 1-2 years, some buy it and even forgot about it until they remember, their coins are already gone 20x, or even 100x.
            <br><br>
            My family used to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2019 and 2020, my dad is a man with a large asset in his hand. He believes that his asset will be enough for him to step into the crypto market, and he was right. However, my dad was really new to crypto, so he doesn’t have any experience with it, therefore, he seeks out help from the community and receives a lot of support from many crypto teams. My dad is in his mid 60 so technology was not to his advantage, so he only lends his money to the traders for them to invest and bring back the profit. But through time, my dad’s money only went down, not a single rise because of bad traders. The result was my dad lost almost 60% of his total asset, which made our family have a financial crisis in a short period of time. We had stopped buying crypto for 1 year, but currently, I had convinced my dad to lend me $12,000 to invest in crypto. Crypto was not a really hard thing to understand and it was not affecting me much since I am a holder. </p>
